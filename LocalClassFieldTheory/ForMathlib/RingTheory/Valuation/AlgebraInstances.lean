# Algebra instances

This file contains several `algebra` and `is_scalar_tower` instances related to extensions
of a field with a valuation, as well as their unit balls.

# Main Definitions
* `valuation_subring_algebra` : Given an algebra between two field extensions `L` and `E` of a
  field `K` with a valuation, create an algebra between their two rings of integers.

# Main Results

* `integral_closure_algebra_map_injective` : the unit ball of a field `K` with respect to a
  valuation injects into its integral closure in a field extension `L` of `K`.

/-- Given an algebra between two field extensions `L` and `E` of a field `K` with a valuation `v`,
  create an algebra between their two rings of integers. For now, this is not an instance by
  default as it creates an equal-but-not-defeq diamond with `algebra.id` when `L = E`.
  This is caused by `x = ⟨x, x.prop⟩` not being defeq on subtypes. It will be an instance when
  ported to Lean 4, since the above will not be an issue. -/
