# Polynomials over the valuation subring.

Given a field `K` with a valuation `v`, in this file we construct a map from polynomials in `K[X]`
with integer coefficients to `v.valuation_subring[X]`. We provide several lemmas to deal with
coefficients, degree, and evaluation of `int_polynomial`.
This is useful when dealing with integral elements in an extension of fields.

# Main Definitions
* `valuation.int_polynomial` : given a polynomial in `K[X]` with coefficients in a field `K` with a
  valuation `v` such that all coefficients belong to `v.valuation_subring`, `int_polynomial` is the
  corresponding polynomial in `v.valuation_subring[X]`.
