# Polynomials over the valuation subring.

Given a field `K` with a valuation `v`, in this file we construct a map from polynomials in `K[X]`
with integer coefficients to `v.valuationSubring[X]`. We provide several lemmas to deal with
coefficients, degree, and evaluation of `intPolynomial`.
This is useful when dealing with integral elements in an extension of fields.

# Main Definitions
* `Valuation.intPolynomial` : given a polynomial in `K[X]` with coefficients in a field `K` with a
  valuation `v` such that all coefficients belong to `v.valuationSubring`, `intPolynomial` is the
  corresponding polynomial in `v.valuationSubring[X]`.
