# Local fields
In this file we define the `class local_field` on a valued field `K`, requiring that it is
* complete (with respect to the uniform structure induced by the valuation)
* that its valuation is discrete
* that the residue field of its unit ball is finite

## Main Definitions
* `local_field` is the key definition, see above.


## Main Results
* For an `eq_char_local_field p K` that is separable over `FpX_completion p` we show that `K` is a
local
field. The separability assumption is required to use some result in mathlib concerning
the finiteness of the ring of integers.
* For a `mixed_char_local_field p K`, we show that `K` is a local field.
